## What is DDD

Dupa-Driven-Development is a set of standards for writing JavaScript code. It focuses on debugging techniques, development process and developer's workflows.

### What does *dupa* mean

Dupa *[Ëˆdupa]* is a polish word used when an issue occurs. For example, you find that your app has crashed on production - "Dupa!". Or your PC had a BSOD but you didn't save your work - "Dupa!". Or something doesn't work and you don't know why - "DUPA!".

Dupa-Driven-Development Standards aim to lower the amount of frustration which comes when dealing with unexpected errors during programming, by implementing special techniques for developers to follow in order to find and debug the issue. 

## Debugging

The best debugging tool is no tool. The important thing when developing Dupa-Driven apps is writing as simple code as possible, so that we can debug it using the simpliest practices. Our best friend is `console.log`.

Although advanced debugging tools may seem helpful, they're hard to set up and take a lot of time to learn using all of their features. Dupa-Driven apps must be light and the development process must be agile, so we need to use the built in tools, which don't require any setup. The best tool is of course the `console.log`.
